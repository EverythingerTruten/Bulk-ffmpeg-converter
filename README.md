# Bulk ffmpeg converter

This program lets you queue and convert any files supported by ffmpeg to .mp4 with an option to give you a notification through discord webhooks. It was first designed to de-interlace .m2ts video.

This program requires ffmpeg installed, which you can do by following this WikiHow tutorial: https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows
